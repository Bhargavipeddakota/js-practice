        <h1 class ='standard'>The Core of Web Design</h1>
        <p>This section is wrapped in a div tag. It contains the main heading and an introductory paragraph about how simple HTML can be. Writing clean code is an essential skill for any developer, as it ensures that the project remains maintainable and easy to understand for anyone else who might look at the source code in the future. By focusing on the basics, we can appreciate how the web was originally built to share information through simple text and document structures.</p>

        <h3>Adding More Context</h3>
        <p>This third section shows how you can repeat this pattern to add as much content as you need. Each new thought gets its own heading and paragraph inside a container. As your page grows, you might find that you need to dive deeper into specific sub-topics, which is where the h3 and h4 tags become incredibly useful. They allow you to break down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable pieces of information that don't overwhelm the person reading your page.</p>

        <h3>Expanding the Project</h3>
        <p>As you add more text, you might notice that the page gets longer and more detailed. You can continue adding divs to separate your biography, your work experience, or even a collection of short stories. There is no limit to how much information a single HTML page can hold, provided you keep it organized. You could even use this structure to create a digital journal, a long-form essay, or a technical manual by simply repeating these core tags over and over again.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Even without complex tags, your message gets across clearly. This is the foundation of every professional site on the web. Mastering these three elements gives you total control over the flow of information. Once you are comfortable with how these tags interact, you will have a solid foundation to build upon if you ever decide to explore more advanced web development concepts in the future.</p>
