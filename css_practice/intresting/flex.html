      <p>Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise
        expressive content.[1][2][3] Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human
        societies.[4] Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach.[5] While scholars agree that music is
        defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements
        are.[6]
        Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity.[7] Diverse activities
        are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into categories of composition, improvisation, and
        performance.[8] Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the human voice.
        It
        can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically,
        such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer.
